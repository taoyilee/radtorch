### :question: What is RADTorch
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
  
RADTorch provides a framework of higher level classes and functions that aim at significantly reducing the time needed for implementation of different machine and deep learning algorithms on DICOM medical images.

RADTorch was **built by radiologists for radiologists** so they can build, test and implement state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in minutes.


RADTorch is built upon widely used machine learning and deep learning frameworks. These include:

1. PyTorch for Deep Learning and Neural Networks.

2. Scikit-learn for Data Management and Machine Learning Algorithms.

3. PyDICOM for handling of DICOM data.

4. Bokeh, Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualization.

### :snowboarder: Getting Started

1. Running a state-of-the-art DICOM image classifier can be run using the Image Classification Pipeline using the commands:
```
from radtorch import pipeline

classifier = pipeline.Image_Classification(data_directory='path to data')
classifier.run()
```
<small>
The above 3 lines of code will run an image classifier using vgg16 model architecture with pre-trained weights for feature extraction and 'logistic_regression' classifier.

2. Image classification demo on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/elbanan/radtorch-demo

3. RADTorch playground for testing is provided on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O7op_RtuNs12uIs0QVbwoeZdtbyQ4Q9i).
